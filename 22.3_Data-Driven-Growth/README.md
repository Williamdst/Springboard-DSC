<h2>Growth Hacking - <i>Data Driven Growth</i></h2>
<b>Part 1: Know Your Metrics</b><br />
In the first part I had information from an online retail store and used the "North Star Metric" of Monthly Revenue to guide the analytics. <i>The North Star Metric is the single metric that best captures the core value that your product delivers to customers.</i> Some of the analytics done were:
<ul>
  <li> Revenue by Type of Customer </li>
  <li> New Customer Ratio </li>
  <li> Cohort Based Retention Rate </li>
</ul>
<br> </br>

<b>Part 2: Customer Segmentation</b><br />
