<h2>Logistic Regression - <i>Introduction to Classification</i> </h2>
In this case study I was introduced to classification via logistic regression using weight/height to predict gender. Although logistic regression has the word "regression" in it is a binary classification problem. Logistic regression does linear regression first and then applies a sigmoid function that "bends" or "squeezes" that line. Logistic regression predicts the probability that something is a class, and those probabilities are then converted into 0 and 1s, based on a threshold.



<h2> Reflection </h2>
<ol>
  <li> As I said in a prior reflection, creating the model is as simple as loading the appropriate scikit library and fitting the data. However, as a data scientist you need to think about scaling, cross-validation, hyperparameter-tuning, class-imbalance, and what type of metrics you will use to evaluate the model.  </li>
