<h2>Big Data Technologies - <i>Introduction to Spark SQL in Python</i> </h2>
PySpark is the Python API written in python to support Apache Spark. Apache Spark is a distributed framework that can handle Big Data analysis. Spark is basically a computational engine, that works with huge sets of data by processing them in parallel and batch systems. <br> </br>

In this case study I learned about Spark Dataframes and how to do basic operations such as filtering and aggregations using the "built-in" functions as well as SQL. From there I looked at basic EDA and applied machine learning on the dataframes. 

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<ol>
  <li>The PySpark dataframe is very similar to the Pandas dataframe and the operations were very similar. Getting things done really is just a matter of syntax.</li>
  <li>Something that I want to explore further is integrating Apache Spark into pipelines that actually have Big Data. </li>
</ol>
