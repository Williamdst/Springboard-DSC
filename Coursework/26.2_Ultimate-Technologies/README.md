<h2>Ultimate Data Scientist - <i>Take Home Challenge II</i></h2>
<b>Part 1: User Logins</b><br />
Aggregate login counts based on 15-minute time intervals, and visualize and describe the resulting time series of login counts in ways that best characterize the underlying patterns of the demand. <br> </br>

<b>Part 2: Experiment & Metrics Design</b><br />
The neighboring cities of Gotham and Metropolis have complementary circadian rhythms: on weekdays, Ultimate Gotham is most active at night, and Ultimate Metropolis is most active during the day. On weekends, there is reasonable activity in both cities. However, a toll bridge, with a two-way toll, between the two cities causes driver partners to tend to be exclusive to each city. The Ultimate managers of city operations for the two cities have proposed an experiment to encourage driver partners to be available in both cities, by reimbursing all toll costs. <b><i>What would you choose as the key measure of success of this experiment in encouraging driver partners to serve both cities and design a practical experiment to compare the effectiveness of the proposed change in relation to the metric.</b></i>


<b>Part 3: Predictive Modeling</b><br />
Build a predictive model to help Ultimate determine whether or not a user will be active in their 6th month on the system, where "active" is described as taking a trip in the preceding 30 days. Discuss how Ultimate might leverage the insights gained from the model to improve its long-term rider retention. 

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Doing machine learning is fun, but it is probably the least important step in the process and data science is so much more than that. 2/3 of this assignment had nothing to do with model building and building the model was probably 5% of the work. And even then model evaluation and interpretation is 10x more important. This is why being a Data Scientist at one company is completely different than being a Data Scientist at another company.  </li>
