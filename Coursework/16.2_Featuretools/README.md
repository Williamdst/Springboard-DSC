Deep feature analysis is about automating feature engineering. Featuretools allows us to perform Deep Feature Synthesis after the data has been prepared as an entity set, which is a collection of entities (tables) and the relationships between them. It creates new features using primitives, which are dataset agnostic features such as max. Max on transaction data gives the most expensive purchase, whereas max on flights gives us the longest delay.

  <li>Automated feature engineering isn't a replacement for manual feature engineering. In fact using them in combination is more beneficial than one or the other. Featuretools can extract more value from the data by using manmade features to automate new ones.
