<h2> London Housing - <i>Basics of Data Science</i></h2>
Combining simple python data structures and ideas such as lists and functions combined with the Pandas package I got my first taste of the Data Science through this case study. I had to load, clean, format, explore, and visulize a dataset of London Housing prices over two decades. The question that I was trying to answer is: <br> </br>

  <li> I realized that data science and the projects associated with them are very similar to doing and presenting math problems. Doing it is extrememly messy and it is in no way a linear process. You are jumping back and forth over and over again, but when projeccts are presented they are presented "perfectly" and it gives the false impression that it was done that way. When looking at other people's projects I was under that impression and felt intimidated by them. 
    
  <li> One of the major challenges that I had was that I felt like I was reacting instead of anticipating. What I mean by this is that for the most part I was unsure about the results of my actions. It felt like I was solving problems that I was creating. I guess what I am trying to say is that although I got to a solution, I am not sure that the path that I took the most efficient
