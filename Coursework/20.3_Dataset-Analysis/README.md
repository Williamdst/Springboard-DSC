The Judas swing term was named by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtjxa77NqamhVC8atV85Rog">The Inner Circle Trader</a>, the idea is, the market makers will rally or sell price, normally just above or below a key level tricking buyers or sellers into the market to follow its direction. As the Judas swing high or low is formed, price is quickly reversed either taking out stops and or leaving traders out of the game. In simpler words, the judas swing is the "False Run" that trips up traders that lack the understanding of the true direction of the day. The underlying idea is that if the market is bullish then market makers will send the price lower first to get a better price and then move it in the bullish direction. The focus of this analysis is to "profile" the GBPUSD trading pair to provide information that could better help with trading. For example, how many pips does te pair move daily or in the case of the Judas swing, how far above/below the open before tthe main move.

<h2>Reflection </h2>
<ol>
  <li> It is crazy how a much insights are buried in a "small" amount of data.</li>
  <li> When you starting doing an analysis, you might have a plan for the questions that you are going to ask but one question always leads to another question and another and another. You can accurately plan out all the questions you <b>WANT</b> to answer, but it's impossible to accurately plan out all the questions you <b>WILL</b> answer.
