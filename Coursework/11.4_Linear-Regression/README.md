The aim is to use exploratory data analysis (EDA) and regression to predict alcohol levels in wine with a model that's as accurate as possible. The core purpose of this case study was to see how linear regression can be implemented in python using both Scikit and Statsmodels packages as well as how to evaluate those models after the fact. The four modles that were built were:
<ul>
  <li> Univariate Linear Regression (<i>SciKit</i>) </li>
  <li> Univariate Linear Regression (<i>StatsModels</i>) </li>
  <li> Multivariate Linear Regression (<i>StatsModels</i>) </li>
  <li> Multivariate Linear Regression w/ Reduced Redundancy (<i>StatsModels</i>) </li>
</ul>

<h2> Reflection </h2>
<ol>
  <li> Evaluating models isn't as straight forward as examing some metric. Model 3 had the best R2 value, but Model 4 performed just as well with reduced redundancy. </li>
  <li> Writing the code to train the model is super simple and takes about 10 lines of code. The bulk of our work as Data Scientists comes from preprocessing the data prior to feeding it into the model and then evaluating the results of those models.
