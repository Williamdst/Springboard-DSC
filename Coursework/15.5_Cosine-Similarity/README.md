Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them. Similarity measures have a multiude of uses in machine learning projects; they come in handy when matching strings, measuring distance, and extracting features. This similarity measurement is particularly concerned with orientation, rather than magnitude. In this case study, I used the cosine similarity to compare both numeric data within a plane and text dataset for string matching.

<h2>Reflection </h2>
<ol>
  <li> The cosine similarity is advantageous because it allows us to think of similarity in a way other than distance. Even if the two similar documents are far apart by the Euclidean distance because of the size they could still have a smaller angle between them.</li>
  <li> Take two pairs of people. The first part grew up in the same city, but had completely different experiences (<i>Euclidean</i>). The other pair had the same experiences, but grew up in different parts of the world (<i>Cosine</i>). The second pair are probably more alike than the first pair, because they can bond over their common experiences. Although the first pair has that common city, that geographical bond would be very weak since they experienced the city in two different ways.
