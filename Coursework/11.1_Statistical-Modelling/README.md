<h2> Statistical Modeling - <i>Python Statistics Essential Training </i> </h2>
<h3> Chapter 4 - Introduction to Statistical Inference </h3>
Statistical inference describes the process of drawing conclusions from data and of understanding the confidence we may have in those conclusions. When drawing conclusions from data there is always an uncertainty because we can only study a limited smaple of the population that we really want to find out about. 

<h3> Chapter 5 - Introduction to Statistical Modeling </h3>
The fundamental goal of statistical modeling is capturing the way in which the variation in one or more response variables is caused by or associated with the variation in one or more explanatory variables. A model can be seen as a function that takes explanatory variables as input and outputs response variables.
