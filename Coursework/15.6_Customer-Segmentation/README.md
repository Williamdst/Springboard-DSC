<h2>Wine Customer Segmentation - <i>Clustering</i> </h2>
This case study invovled a wine retailer and the data generate from different marketing campaigns. They had an excel file that contained two sheets. One sheet were the details of the marketing campaigns that they sent out to customers. It had details such as the time of year and the variety of the wine featured. The other sheet contained which customers responded to which offers and made a purchase. The objective was to use the responses to group similar minded customers together.

<ol>
  <li> There are a lot of clustering algorithms and something that I want to be able to do is know which clusteting algorithm would work best for the data I am working with. Being able to do this will probably require me to look under the hood of the algorithms and dive deep into the mathematics behind them.
  <li> One clustering algorithm that I am drawn to is the Mean Shift algorithm, because you don't need to know how many clusters to use beforehand and you really only need to tune the bandwidth parameter. I can see myself using this algorithm in the future as an exploratory tool.
