<h2> Frequentist Inference </h2>
The case started with a town of 50,000 people and we want to make a claim about the parameters of the height distribution such as the mean and the standard deviation. We can go out an sample all 50,000 people or we can create experiments that leverage the Central Limit Theorem by constructing experiments that create a distribution of means and then estimates the population mean and standard deviation within confidence intervals. <br> </br>

Building on that I then used the knowledge to answer business operations questions at a hospital. Specifically the hospital wanted to determine if their revenue stream was declining below an acceptable threshold. Additionally, the hospital wanted to know whether poeple with insurancce was getting charged differently than people without. To answer this used the SciPy ttest function to test the null hypothesis that the two groups of patients were being charged the same.
