<h2> SQL Country Club - <i> Relational Databases & SQL </i> </h2>
In this assignment I worked with a relational database and used SQL to answer data analytics questions. The database represented a Country Club and the three tables were: Facilites, Members, & Bookings. The Bookings table listed which member booked which facility and for how long. <br> </br>

Some questions had to be answered by integrating the connection and the query into a python script using packages such as psycopg, sqlite3, and mysql.connector. Other questions needed to be answered directly using management tools such as PHPMyAdmin and pgAdmin. Some smaple questions asked were:
<ul>
  <li> Produce a report of members and who recommended them in alphabetic surname, firstname order </li>
  <li> Produce a list of facilities with a total revenue less than 1000. The output of facility name and total revenue, sorted by revenue. <i>Remember that there's a different cost for guests and members </i>.
</ul>
