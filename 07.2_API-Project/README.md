<h2> API Mini Project - <i>APIs & The Python Standard Library</i> </h2>
This mini project focused on equities data from the Frankfurt Stock Exhange (FSE) on the Quandl platform. Specifically a company called Carl Zeiss Meditec, which manufactures tools for eye examinations, as well as medical lasers for laser eye surgery. To get the data, APIs were introduced and I was shown how you can leverage a platforms API to get data. Additionally, the heavy lifting that Pandas does was stripped away and everything was done only using the Python Standard Library and its native data structures. Some sample questions asked were:

<ul>
  <li> Calculate what the highest and lowest opening prices were for the stock in this period.
  <li> What was the largest change in any one day (based on High and Low price)?
  <li> What was the median trading volume during this year?
</ul>

<h2> Reflection </h2>
<ol>
  <li> Pandas does <b>A LOT</b> of the heavy lifting and is an overpowered package </li>
  <li> Having an understanding of the native python data structures is important. Knowing which structure to use given the data that you are working with can save you many lines of code which translates to many hours of time.
    <li> This mini project has sparked my interest in software engineering and how engineers go about solving problems and how they pick data structures. Also, I am curious as to how they build these APIs on the backend
</ol>
