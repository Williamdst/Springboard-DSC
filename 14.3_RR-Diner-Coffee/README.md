<h2> Coffee Diner Horizontal Expansion - <i>Decision Trees</i> </h2>
RR Diner is a B2B coffee distributor that was looking to make a decision about whether to make a deal with a coffee farm that produces unique beans in an effort to expand its product range. The company wanted to know whether it would be a profitable expenditure. <br> </br>

The data came from a survey that was sent out to about 700 customers which a question on whether they would buy the unique beans. 0s and 1s were assigned to customers whether they said no or yes to the coffee and nulls if they didnâ€™t answer. <br> </br>

Combined with the data that the company already had on the customers machine learning were used to determine what the potential value of the nulls would be based on a trained decision tree model using the survey answers as the training set. If 70% of the customers, including the customers predicted, said they would buy the company would make the deal. 

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<ol>
  <li>I really enjoyed this case study because it showed how machine learning can be used in a business setting to help make important decisions that would effect the companies growth.</li>
  <li> Unless the machine learning model is the product, it shouldn't be the end all be all. Businesses shouldn't make all their decisions solely on the output of a model. The outputs should be used as a piece of a larger body of evidence.
