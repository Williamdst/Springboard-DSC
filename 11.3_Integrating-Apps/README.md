<h2> App Store Integration - <i> </i> </h2>
A developer and his team wants to integrate an app store into his software, but he only has room in the budget to integrate a single app store. They decide that they will integrate whichever app store has the highest quality apps, quality being defined as the overall rating of all the applications. As the data science on the team it is my job to use application data from both the iOS App Store and the Google Play store to determine if there is a quality difference. <br> </br>

After finding the average rating and taking the difference between the two there was a difference in rating, but I have to figure out if the difference is significant by running a series of permutation tests where the statistic being tested was the difference of the means. 


<h2> Reflection </h2>

  <li> Similar to the hospital case study, this study showed me how statistics is used in a data science context. In both cases statistics was used to investigate and verify something. I a beginning to see why statistis pops up on every "Skills Data Scientist Should Have" list. Statistics is the tool that provides you the evidence required to justify a call to action.
