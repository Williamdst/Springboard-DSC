<h2> COVID-19 - <i> Ensemble Methods I: Bagging - Random Forests </i> </h2>
This case study is an excellent example of how data scientists can help share crucial insights about occurrences that have an impact around the world. This case study uses the Random Forest Classifier and a dataset from the South Korean cases of COVID-19 provided on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kimjihoo/coronavirusdataset">Kaggle</a> to encourage research on this important topic. The goal of the case study is to build a Random Forest Classifier to predict the 'state' of the patient. <br> </br>

The fundamental idea behind a random forest is to combine many decision trees into a single model. When combined together, individual predictions are more accurate than stand-alone predicitons. By taking a subset of both the samples and the features to train each model, each tree brings their own background experience and information sources. 

<h2> Reflection </h2>
<ol>
  <li> Although random forests are robust, they add another layer of complexity to model selection in the form of hyperparameter-tuning. Random forests have many parameters and trying to tune the model can be computationally heavy.
